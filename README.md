### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mark and I am a websites/app builder. I design, code, architect and operate small to large websites and apps.

In my professional career I have worked at various companies doing diverse projects. Ranging from from scratch CMS implementations, community sites, improving performance of existing software, designing high performance game backends, financial systems to single page web apps and mobile apps.

If you want to know more about me, have a look at my [website](https://www.vectos.net)

Over the past few years I've gotten production experience with Functional Scala. While my focus is on coding at the moment, I also recently got certified in Kubernetes and UX/UI design. With my experience and skills I hope I can help you with your digital experience
