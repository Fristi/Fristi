### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mark de Jong and I like functional programming in Scala and Haskell. Also I have an interest in simple UX / UI design.
Currently working as a freelancer @ DHL. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DHL projects written in Scala, cats, cats-effect, cats-tagless, fs2, doobie, http4s and ZIO :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UX / UI design

Some interesting presentations I've done can be found here:
